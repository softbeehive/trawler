Test task description
---------------------
The goal of this exercise is to build a scraper process and a single page web app.

Important notes and considerations
You are free to use whatever tools you feel are appropriate for the job at hand. Please keep in mind though, that your choice may impact how you fulfill the requirements below. If you do pick tools which do not enable this out of the box, we’ll want you to specify how you’d configure them to make this possible. 

Also, like all things, we may want to add new content to the system, so make sure you abstract data sources from the rest.

Requirements
Using Flickr's API or scraping the HTML found at  http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=education have a scraping process store in a database at least the following fields: image URL, width, height, title and owner. This process should be able to be executed manually or automatically by a recurring job.
Do a simple front end single page application (no refreshing) to show these image listings (also paginated). This application must have the means of allowing the user to search by each of the attributes specified above.

Additional considerations
For the backend part, this exercise must be coded in PHP 5.x. You are free to use whatever frameworks you’re comfortable working with. Keep in mind, however, that you’re expected to know what is happening under the hood, so be prepared to discuss the implementation and lower level details once you submit your project.

Evaluation criteria
This test task helps us evaluate how you approach software development, defensive programming and how you interpret requirements.

We don’t want to leave you in the dark when in comes to how your test task will be evaluated, so here are the evaluation criteria:
Structured approach to coding, such as MVC
Follows SOLID principles as much as possible
Minimal coupling/dependencies between components
Writes clear, consistent, easy to read and easy to follow code
Follows clear and consistent naming conventions

Assuming you pass the test task, please expect a brief discussion during the follow up interview, with perhaps some requirement changes and how you would implement them.

We hope you have fun implementing this simple project. We can’t wait to see what you come up with. Good luck!
